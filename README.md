# Baseball Hall of Fame Predictor

The goal of this project is twofold:

1. To determine the hall of fame worthiness of current Major League Baseball (MLB) players.

2. To determine which Hall of Fame players some of the most noteworthy current players are most similar to.

## The Process

The data was obtained from [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) and can be found under [data](https://github.com/apyeh/BaseballHOF/tree/master/data) folder.

Data processing was done in Pandas, and model building was done using machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn.

iPython notebooks containing exploratory analysis and tinkering are under the [notebooks](https://github.com/apyeh/BaseballHOF/tree/master/notebooks) folder.

Code for the data cleaning/processing, model building, and visualizations are under the [code](https://github.com/apyeh/BaseballHOF/tree/master/code) folder.
